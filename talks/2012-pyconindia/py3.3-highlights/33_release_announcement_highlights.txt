Python 3.3 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, as well as easier porting between 2.x and 3.x. Major new features in the 3.3 release series are:

    PEP 380, syntax for delegating to a subgenerator (yield from)
    PEP 393, flexible string representation (doing away with the distinction between "wide" and "narrow" Unicode builds)
    A C implementation of the "decimal" module, with up to 80x speedup for decimal-heavy applications
    The import system (__import__) is based on importlib by default
    The new "lzma" module with LZMA/XZ support
    PEP 405, virtual environment support in core
    PEP 420, namespace package support
    PEP 3151, reworking the OS and IO exception hierarchy
    PEP 3155, qualified name for classes and functions
    PEP 409, suppressing exception context
    PEP 414, explicit Unicode literals to help with porting
    PEP 418, extended platform-independent clocks in the "time" module
    PEP 412, a new key-sharing dictionary implementation that significantly saves memory for object-oriented code
    The new "faulthandler" module that helps diagnosing crashes
    The new "unittest.mock" module
    The new "ipaddress" module
    A "collections.ChainMap" class for linking mappings to a single unit
    Wrappers for many more POSIX functions in the "os" and "signal" modules, as well as other useful functions such as "sendfile()"
    Hash randomization, introduced in earlier bugfix releases, is now switched on by default
