- really condense the history

- some diagrams to give more context

- much briefer coverage of the near term fixes

- reorder new metadata standard bullet points

- break it up by problem rather than presenting all the problems then all
  the solutions

If keeping PEP history (which I probably won't)
- describe PEP process
- date the changes to BDFL delegates
