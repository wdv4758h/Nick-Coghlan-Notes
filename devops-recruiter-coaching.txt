Hi <recruiter's name>,

Thank you for your expression of interest in my work.

The wording of your recruiting pitch suggests that your organisation may be
struggling to come to grips with the rich concepts of empathetic collaboration
and cooperation encapsulated in the term "DevOps".

While there are a lot of folks out there that will happily tell you "hire me
and you'll be doing DevOps", and there are also plenty of vendors that will tell
you "buy our tools or subscribe to our services and you'll be doing DevOps",
the truth is that DevOps refers primarily to a cultural shift of developers
caring about their impact on operations teams, and operations teams caring
about their impact on development teams.

Anyone that tries to actually put DevOps principles into practice, however, will
soon find that the implications of thinking outside the boundaries of one's
immediate role go far beyond those two groups. How will negotiating new service
agreements impact Finance? What are the Legal implications of sharing data with
third party services? Is there a Marketing opportunity here in describing the
way we use our own products?

Individuals and tools may help nudge organisations in the direction of that
change, but in the absence of high levels of support for breaking down
institutional silos and removing barriers to effective collaboration, folks
are more likely to get frustrated, burn out and leave than they are to have
a major impact on the organisation.

I'm afraid it doesn't sound to me like you're thinking in terms of that kind of
significant business transformation, so I suspect you're only going to attract
folks that will tell you what you want to hear, rather than helping you
address the root causes of the problems you need to solve.

If that prospect concerns you, then you may want to read this excellent
interview with Elastic's Robyn Bergeron
(http://opensource.com/business/15/6/interview-robyn-bergeron-elastic), or
perhaps consider picking up a copy of Gene Kim's "The Phoenix Project"
(http://www.amazon.com/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592).

Regards,
<your name>
