    "================================\n",
    "\n",
    "[Digital Blasphemy](http://digitalblasphemy.com) is a great site where the digital artist Ryan Bliss posts a wide variety of wallpapers for download.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a selection of the pieces are available for free, subscribing to the site provides access to all of the images at a variety of resolutions. Given how much I like Ryan's art, I signed up initially for the lifetime membership and later for his [Patreon subscription](https://www.patreon.com/dblasphemy?ty=h) to help ensure I'll have more artwork to download in the future :)\n",
    "\n",
    "I've long used a random selection of the Digital Blasphemy artwork as the desktop background on my personal laptop, but updating the available images has been a matter of downloading the complete zip archives at the relevant resolutions, unzipping them to the appropriate location, and then going through them to delete the few that I know I don't like (or don't mind myself, but wouldn't be happy to have on-screen at a professional conference).\n",
    "\n",
    "It had been a while since I last did that and I decided that *this* time, I'd solve the problem in a more sensible way, by figuring out a way to automate the process of checking for images I didn't have (in the resolutions I care about) and downloading them to the right location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packaging that up properly as a command line application would be a lot of work that wouldn't really help *me*, but by using an IPython notebook, I was able to convert my experimental code to see how I could retrieve the relevant data from the site directly into something that actually solved my original problem :)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name Digital Blasphemy sounds vaguely familiar, it may be due to *this* image (or one of its earlier incarnations):\n",
