Python 3
========

At the instigation of Guido van Rossum (the Benevolent Dictator for Life for
the Python language specification and the CPython reference implementation),

series to the infamously incompatible Python 3 series.

This page collects a series of essays I have written covering various
aspects of the Python 3 transition (as well as Python 3 features in general).
