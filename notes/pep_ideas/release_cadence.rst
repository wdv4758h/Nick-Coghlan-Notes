Feature Release Cadence
=======================

This will be a PEP proposing a simpler alternative to :pep`407` and
:pep:`413` that merely releases alpha versions of the upcoming feature
release early.

The meaning of an "alpha" release will be clarified to say that all stability
guidelines for *existing* APIs remain in force, but all APIs that have not
yet been part of a release must be considered provisional, as defined in
:pep:`411`.
