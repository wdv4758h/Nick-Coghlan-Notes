Else Clauses on Loop Statements
===============================

Python's loop statements have a feature that some people love (Hi!), some
people hate, many have never encountered and many just find confusing: an
``else`` clause.

This article endeavours to explain some of the reasons behind the frequent
confusion, and explore some other ways of thinking about the problem that
give a better idea of what is *really* going on with these clauses.


Reasons for Confusion
---------------------

The major reason many developers find the behaviour of these clauses
potentially confusing is shown in the following example::

    >>> if [1]:
    ...     print("Then")
    ... else:
    ...     print("Else")
    ...
    Then
    >>> for x in [1]:
    ...     print("Then")
    ... else:
    ...     print("Else")
    ...
    Then
    Else

The ``if <iterable>`` header looks very similar to the ``for <var> in
<iterable>`` header, so it's quite natural for people to assume they're
related and expect the ``else`` clause to be skipped in both cases. As the
example shows, this assumption is incorrect: in the second case, the else
clauses triggers even though the iterable isn't empty.

If we then look at a common ``while`` loop pattern instead, it just deepens
the confusion because *it* seems to line up with the way we would expect
the conditional to work::

    >>> x = [1]
    >>> while x:
    ...     print("Then")
    ...     x.pop()
    ... else:
    ...     print("Else")
    ...
    Then
    Else
    >>> if x:
    ...     print("Then")
    ... else:
    ...     print("Else")
    ...
    Else

Here, the loop runs until the iterable is empty, and then the ``else``
clause is executed, just as it is in the ``if`` statement.


A different kind of ``else``
----------------------------

So what's going on? The truth is that the superficial similarity between
``if <iterable>`` and ``for <var> in <iterable>`` is rather deceptive. If
we call the ``else`` clause on an ``if`` statement a "conditional else", then
we can look to ``try`` statements for a different *kind* of ``else`` clause,
a "completion clause"::

    >>> try:
    ...     pass
    ... except:
    ...     print("Then") # The try block threw an exception
    ... else:
    ...     print("Else") # The try block didn't throw an exception
    ...
    Else

With a completion clause, the question being asked has to do with how
an earlier suite of code *finished*, rather than checking the boolean value
of an expression. Reaching the ``else`` clause in a ``try`` statement means
that the try block actually completed successfully - it didn't throw
an exception or otherwise terminate before reaching the end of the suite.

This is actually a much better model for what's going on in our ``for`` loop,
since the condition the ``else`` is checking for is whether or not the loop
was explicitly terminated by a ``break`` statement. While it's not legal
syntax, it may be helpful to mentally insert an ``except break: pass``
whenever you encounter a loop with an associated ``else`` clause in order
to help remember what it means::

    for x in iterable:
        ...
    except break:
        pass # Implied by Python's loop semantics
    else:
        ...  # No break statement was encountered

    while condition:
        ...
    except break:
        pass # Implied by Python's loop semantics
    else:
        ...  # No break statement was encountered


What possible use is the current behaviour?
-------------------------------------------

The main use case for this behaviour is to implement search loops, where
you're performing a search for an item that meets a particular condition,
and need to perform additional processing or raise an informative error if
no acceptable value is found::

    for x in data:
        if acceptable(x):
            break
    else:
        raise ValueError("No acceptable value in {!r:100}".format(data))

    ... # Continue calculations with x


But how do I check if my loop never ran at all?
-----------------------------------------------

The easiest way to check if a ``for`` loop never executed is to use ``None``
as a sentinel value::

    x = None
    for x in data:
        ... # process x
    if x is None:
        raise ValueError("Empty data iterable: {!r:100}".format(data))

If ``None`` is a legitimate data value, then a custom sentinel object can be
used instead::

    x = _empty = object()
    for x in data:
        ... # process x
    if x is _empty:
        raise ValueError("Empty data iterable: {!r:100}".format(data))

For ``while`` loops, the appropriate solution will depend on the details of
the loop.


But couldn't Python be different?
---------------------------------

Backwards compatibility constraints and the general desire not to change
the language core without a compelling justification mean that the answer to
this question is likely always going to be "No".

The simplest approach for any new language to take to avoid the confusion
encountered in relation to this feature of Python would be to just leave it
out altogether. Many (most?) other languages don't offer it, and there are
certainly other ways to handle the search loop use case, including a
sentinel based approach similar to that used to detect whether or not a
loop ran at all::

    result = _not_found = object()
    for x in data:
        if acceptable(x):
            result = x
            break
    if result is _not_found:
        raise ValueError("No acceptable value in {!r:100}".format(data))

    ... # Continue calculations with result


Closing note: Not so different after all?
-----------------------------------------

Attentive readers may have noticed that the behaviour of ``while`` loops
still makes sense regardless of whether you think of their ``else`` clause as
a conditional else or as a completion clause. We can think of a ``while``
statement in terms of an infinite loop containing a ``break`` statement::

    while True:
        if condition:
            pass # Implied by Python's loop semantics
        else:
            ... # While loop else clause runs here
            break
        ... # While loop body runs here

If you dig deep enough, it's also possible to relate the completion clause
constructs in ``try`` statements and ``for`` loops back to the basic
conditional else construct. The thing to remember though, is that it is
only ``while`` loops and ``if`` statements that are checking the boolean
value of an expression, while ``for`` loops and ``try`` statements are
checking whether or not a section of code was aborted before completing
normally.

However, digging to that deeper level doesn't really provide much more
enlightenment when it comes to understanding how the two different forms
of ``else`` clause work in practice.
